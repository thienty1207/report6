# Technical Requirements: Aircraft Parts Optimal Order Time Prediction System

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the technical specifications for developing a new feature that predicts and suggests optimal times to order aircraft parts based on historical data, usage patterns, and supply chain factors.

## 2. System Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

#### Data Collection and Analysis
- System must integrate with existing aircraft maintenance database to access:
  - Part replacement history
  - Part lifespan data
  - Maintenance schedules
  - Aircraft usage logs
- System must collect and store supply chain data:
  - Vendor delivery times
  - Part availability
  - Shipping delays and seasonal variations
  - Price fluctuations

#### Prediction Engine
- Develop an algorithm to predict part failure or replacement needs using:
  - Machine learning models trained on historical replacement data
  - Statistical analysis of mean time between failures (MTBF)
  - Seasonal trends in part failures
  - Aircraft utilization impact on part wear

#### Order Time Optimization
- Calculate optimal order times based on:
  - Predicted replacement date
  - Current inventory levels
  - Vendor lead times
  - Shipping transit times
  - Safety stock requirements
  - Cost optimization factors

#### User Interface
- Dashboard for maintenance planners showing:
  - Parts predicted to need replacement within configurable timeframes
  - Suggested order dates with confidence levels
  - Risk assessments for delaying orders
  - Historical accuracy of predictions

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Prediction calculations must complete within 30 seconds
- System must handle data for fleet of up to 500 aircraft
- Dashboard must load within 3 seconds

#### Security
- Role-based access control for different user types
- Secure API endpoints for data integration
- Audit logging for all order recommendations and actions taken

#### Reliability
- 99.5% uptime during operational hours
- Automated data validation to detect anomalous inputs
- Graceful degradation if data sources are temporarily unavailable
